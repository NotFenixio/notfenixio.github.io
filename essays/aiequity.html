            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Introduction</h3>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making big waves in our world. You've got platforms like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>Claude</strong> joining the AI trend, offering free chatbots. But with all this AI growth, come some challenges. Let's dive into the idea of making AI fair and equal for everyone.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Microsoft Dilemma</h3>
            
            <p>Let's talk about <strong>Microsoft</strong>. They've hopped on the AI bandwagon in the corporate world. It's not their usual gig, but they're making some noteworthy moves.</p>
            
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li><strong>Bing Chat</strong>: Microsoft stepped into the ring with Bing Chat, a chatbot right in their Bing search engine. They wanted to challenge Google, but let's be honest, Google's search results are hard to beat. Bing Chat is struggling to compete.</li>
                <li><strong>Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong>: On paper, this service sounds greatâ€”a promise of an AI copilot in Microsoft 365 (all the Office apps). But there's a catch. It seems it's only for the big corporations with more than <strong>300 employees</strong>. The little guys are left out, and that's not cool. For more details, check out <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-is-generally-available/bc-p/3970181/highlight/true#M72" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">this comment</a> in Microsoft's official announcement.</li>
                <li><strong>Windows with built-in AI</strong>: Microsoft went all-in by putting AI into its Windows operating system. Some love the idea, while others think it's a power move. This makes Windows the first OS with built-in AI, giving Microsoft even more control.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>All of this shows that Microsoft is seriously into AI in their products and services. But it's sparking worries about fair AI sharing. The big companies get the benefits, while the smaller ones are left in the lurch. So, the big question is: Is AI really accessible to everyone?</p>
