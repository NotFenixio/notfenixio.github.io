            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Introduction</h3>

            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is on a fast track to change the world we live in. Platforms like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>Claude</strong> have jumped on the bandwagon, offering free access to conversational chatbots. But with all this AI growth, what challenges come along for the ride? In this essay, we're going to take a deep dive into the whole idea of making AI access fair and equal for everyone.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Microsoft Dilemma</h3>

            <p>Now, let's talk about <strong>Microsoft</strong>. They've become a big name when it comes to embracing AI in the corporate world. It might not have been their usual thing, but they're making some moves that are making folks scratch their heads.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc">
            <li><strong>Bing Chat</strong>: Microsoft threw their hat in the ring with Bing Chat, a chatbot that's built right into their Bing search engine. They were aiming to give Google, the reigning champ, a run for its money. But let's be real, Google's got the upper hand with better search results, so Bing Chat is having a tough time making the sale.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong>: This service looks good on paper, promising to have an AI copilot in Microsoft 365 (you know, all the Office apps). But some folks are raising their eyebrows because not everyone can get in on the fun. Microsoft seems to be showing love to the big corporations with more than <strong>300 employees</strong>, leaving the little guys out in the cold when it comes to working more efficiently. If you want more details, check out <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-is-generally-available/bc-p/3970181/highlight/true#M72" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">this comment</a> in Microsoft's official announcement.</li>
            <li><strong>Windows with built-in AI</strong>: Microsoft went all-in by integrating AI into its Windows operating system. Some people are cheering them on for this, while others think it's a power play. It means Windows is the first operating system with AI built right into it, which could mean even more control for Microsoft.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>All of this tells us that Microsoft is going all-in on AI in their products and services. But it's got people worried about whether AI is being shared fairly. The big corporations seem to be reaping the rewards, while the smaller players are left to fend for themselves. So, it leaves us with a question: Is AI really something everyone can get their hands on?</p>
